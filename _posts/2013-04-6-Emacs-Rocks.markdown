If you always wondered if it pays off to learn how to use Emacs
(spoiler: the answer is most certainly yes),
[Emacs Rocks!](http://emacsrocks.com/) is for
you. [Magnar Sveen](https://twitter.com/emacsrocks) produced more than
a dozen of screencasts presenting cool editing features of Emacs.

One of my favorites is this one, demonstrating the power of macros and
elisp.

Magnar also has blog about useful snippets for Emacs at
[What the .emacs.d?](http://whattheemacsd.com/).  Note that many of
the posts presented there found their way into the excellent
[Emacs Prelude](http://batsov.com/prelude), which I highly recommend
to have a sane start with many powerful features already
preconfigured.
