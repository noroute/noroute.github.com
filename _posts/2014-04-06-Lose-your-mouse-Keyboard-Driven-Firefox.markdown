If you've read one of the

you may have already guessed that keybindings don't stop with the OS.

I spend a lot of time in a web browser so I also tried to optimize
operating my browser use, meaning less mouse usage.

# Immediate gains - Built-in key bindings
If you're currently mostly using the mouse, using the built-in
keybindings can already speed up your browsing experience a lot. These
are the ones I use the most.

(Note that these are on a Mac, most of these work on other operating
systems if you replace `Cmd` with `Ctrl`.)

{% highlight text %}
Cmd-T (New Tab)
Cmd-W (Close Tab)
Cmd-N (New Window)
Ctrl-Tab (Cycle Tabs)
Cmd-Left (Back)
Cmd-Right (Forward)
Shift-Cmd-H (History)
{% endhighlight %}

If you're on a Mac, `Cmd-backtick` is another helpful addition,
cycling through your browser windows.

## Efficiency galore - find-as-you-type
Firefox sports two find-as-you-type modes, the more useful one being
mostly unknown.

`/` triggers find as you type for the page content (`Cmd-g` jumps to
the next match).  This is pretty useful but only `'` brings out
mouse-less browsing. It triggers find-as-you-type for *links*. Typing
the first characters of link text selects the link, `Return` will
follow the link (`Shift-Return` opens the link in a new tab).

*Put away your mouse and try this for a day!*
