I'm fairly comfortable using a Mac with mostly keyboard shortcuts, but
the problem of moving windows around and resizing remained
unsovled. Till now! Enter [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate).

Slate makes an application fullscreen, right-half, or left-half with a
single (eh, actually two) keypress. You can directly jump to one
specific application or even throw a window to a different screen.

# Installation

Since Slate is most useful when it can have dedicated global keyboard
shortcuts, which are difficult to come by on a Mac, I use Caps-Lock as
Super and use that for all Slate keybindings.  This does not come
built-in but can be done with two tools:

 1. Disable Caps-Lock in the Mac's keyboard settings (Keyboard -> Modifier Keys -> No Action)
 2. Install [PcKeyboardHack](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/pckeyboardhack.html.en) and set Caps-Lock to keycode 62 (right-control, which you might just not have anyway)
 3. Install [Keyremap4Macbook](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/) and set "Remap Right Control to Hyper"
 4. Rejoice and use Hyper/Super in your Slate onfig ([here's mine](https://github.com/noroute/portable-environment/blob/master/.slate))!

# Caveats

Beware, Slate has a ton of config options and features and the
configuration format is a bit arcane. Limit yourself to some basic
operations at first, to get comfortable. See if you need more,
later. You can find
[my config here](https://github.com/noroute/portable-environment/blob/master/.slate),
it is still very basic.
